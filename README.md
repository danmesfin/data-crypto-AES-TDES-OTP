DataCrypto is a web based illustration/implementation of cryptography in secure message communication.

## Getting Started

First, Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danmesfin/data-crypto-AES-TDES-OTP <YOUR PROJECT NAME>

```

cd YOUR PROJECT NAME and run:

```bash
npm install
```

then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
#

yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
